		New York, USA, 2016. New England Ecostery Network; Stage One.
		</p>
		<p>
		This is a test! It's only a test. You're invited to join, to play, to learn, to give, and to grow in new directions. Please read on, and know that your attention and support are greatly valued.		</p>
		<p>
		The Testlab project at the Abode beginning in 2016 will leverage the core of the unMonastery model to work towards the launch of a full featured collaborative live-work-learn environment at this unique and promising location. A “test lab” in unMonastery speak is a temporary hatching zone with essential ingredients to support small teams fulfilling primary goals at “proof of concept” stage, in specific focus areas.
		</p>
		<p>
		If successful, and the momentum carries forward, a more elaborate and enduring unMonastery-Ecostery residential program may take root.

        	Why here, why now? <a href="http://theabode.org">The Abode of the Message</a> is a spiritually oriented intentional community and retreat center established in 1975 by the <a href="http://inayatiorder.org/">Sufi Order International</a> as a place of study, growth, communion, and devoted practice for people of many backgrounds and beliefs. Previously, during the 19th century, this same location was the epicenter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers">Shaker</a> religious movement in America, one of the largest and most successful utopian societies in history.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        	The Abode community is presently growing and transitioning to incorporate a larger and more diverse set of residents, guests, programs, and activities on site. Of particular interest is the expansion of land based projects and learning, given the property’s extraordinary 400 acre campus which includes an active organic farm, mountain summer camp, and wilderness school.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        	Right now is a great time to invite a fresh, conscientious, enthusiastic, creative crew to engage with the Abode community cultivating a slew of new possibilities for the center, the surrounding region, and our wider networks. It’s a vigorous, fresh phase, in a very special place. There's so much within reach! The adjacent Berkshire region of Massachusetts, Hudson Valley of New York, and large population centers just beyond (2.5 hours to Boston or NYC) make this an extraordinary setting that feels secluded and pristine while at the same time both connected and consequential.

        	So, what's the story, and who's running this show anyways? It’s still early. The right answers will emerge, with your help. The invitation is open, here and now, to those adventurous souls wanting a hand in the start of something new, fresh, exciting, and very open to innovative means. Could that be you?
